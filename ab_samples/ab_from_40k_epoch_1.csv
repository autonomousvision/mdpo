2. For an integer $n \geqslant 1$ we consider sequences of $2 n$ numbers, each equal to $0,-1$ or 1 . The sum product value of such a sequence is calculated by first multiplying each pair of numbers from the sequence, and then adding all the results together.

For example, if we take $n=2$ and the sequence $0,1,1,-1$, then we find the products $0 \cdot 1, \quad 0 \cdot 1$, $0 \cdot-1, \quad 1 \cdot 1, \quad 1 \cdot-1, \quad 1 \cdot-1$. Adding these six results gives the sum product value of this sequence: $0+0+0+1+(-1)+(-1)=-1$. The sum product value of this sequence is therefore smaller than the sum product value of the sequence $0,0,0,0$, which equals 0 .

Determine for each integer $n \geqslant 1$ the smallest sum product value that such a sequence of $2 n$ numbers could have.

Attention: you are required to prove that a smaller sum product value is impossible.

Just as in decimal addition, ""carry over when reaching ten,"" in binary, ""carry over when reaching 2."" Thus, we can obtain the following table comparing the decimal and binary representations of natural numbers:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Decimal & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & $\cdots$ \\

The matches will be played in a round-robin format (i.e., each team will play one match against every other team). The rules are: 3 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, and 1 point for each team in a draw. The ranking will be determined by the total points, and if two teams have the same points, the goal difference, head-to-head results, and other factors will be considered to determine the ranking.

hexagon $ABCDEF$. Two or more players collide when they‘re on the same vertex. When this happens, all the colliding players lose and the game ends. Every second, Bamal and Halvan teleport to a random vertex adjacent to their current position (each with probability $\dfrac{1}{2}$), and Zuca teleports to a random vertex adjacent to his current position, or to the vertex directly opposite him (each with probability $\dfrac{1}{3}$). What is the probability that when [i]The Game[/i] ends Zuca hasn‘t lost?

[i]Proposed by Edwin Zhao[/i]

[hide=Solution][i]Solution.[/i] $\boxed{\dfrac{29}{90}}$
Color the vertices alternating black and white. By a parity argument if someone is on a different color than the other
two they will always win. Zuca will be on opposite parity from the others with probability $\dfrac{3}{10}$. They will all be on the same parity with probability $\dfrac{1}{10}$.

At this point there are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$ possible moves. $3$ of these will lead to the same arrangement, so we disregard those. The other $9$ moves are all equally likely to end the game. Examining these, we see that Zuca will win in exactly $2$ cases (when Bamal and Halvan collide and Zuca goes to a neighboring vertex). Combining all of this, the answer is
$$\dfrac{3}{10}+\dfrac{2}{9} \cdot \dfrac{1}{10}=\boxed{\dfrac{29}{90}}$$

Unless otherwise stated, throughout the following, $p$ will denote a prime number, and we will work in the field $\mathbb{Z} / \mathrm{p} \mathbb{Z}$.

If $A$ is an integral domain, many results that are true in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ remain true in $A[X]$. In particular, there exists a Euclidean division by unitary polynomials, if $r \in A$ is a root of $P \in A[X]$, then $P(X)$ is divisible by $X-r$, and a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ roots, counted with multiplicities. Consequently, if a polynomial $P$ is of degree $n$, has leading coefficient $\lambda$, has roots $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{k}$ with respective multiplicities $\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{k}$ such that $\alpha_{1}+\ldots+\alpha_{k}=n$, then $P(X)=\lambda\left(X-r_{1}\right)^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots\left(X-r_{k}\right)^{\alpha_{k}}$. If, moreover, $A$ is a field, then there is a Euclidean division by any non-zero polynomial, and in $A[X]$ there is a GCD, an LCM, Bézout's theorem, and Gauss's theorem, and the existence and uniqueness of the decomposition into a product of irreducibles.

At a class party, the students present their math teacher with the following problem:

The students inform their teacher that they have secretly divided themselves into three groups such that every student in the class belongs to exactly one group. The students in the first group call themselves the ""Trues"" because they answer every question truthfully.

The students in the second group call themselves the ""Falses"" because they answer every question falsely. The students in the third group call themselves the ""Inconstant"" because each of them answers series of consecutive questions alternately (alternating) true and false; however, it is uncertain whether they will answer the first question of a series true or false.

Each student answers a question posed to them only with yes or no; questions that require other answers are not allowed. The teacher is to determine, by asking questions directed to any student in the class, which only concern the student's affiliation with one of the mentioned groups, whether the student is a ""True,"" a ""False,"" or an ""Inconstant.""

We choose 2 scripts randomly and, if the scores on both of them are odd number, we add one mark to one of them, put the script back in the box and keep the other script outside. If both scripts have even scores, we put back one of the scripts and keep the other outside. If there is one script with even score and the other with odd score, we put back the script with the odd score and keep the other script outside. After following this procedure a number of times, there are 3 scripts left among which there is at least one script each with odd and even scores. Find, with proof, the number of scripts with odd scores among the three left.

$$
10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10=1000
$$

We will derive the formula for the number $A$, which is divisible by 5 and has a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. This number has the form

$$
A=5 k=7 n+3
$$

Solving the equation $5 k-7 n=3$ in integers, we find

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
k=7 t+2 \\
n=5 t+1
\end{array}\right.
$$

Therefore, $A=35 t+10, t \in Z, t \geq 0$. Since by the problem's condition $A$ is a three-digit number, we have $100 \leq 35 t+10 \leq 999$. From this, taking into account the integer nature of $t$, we get $t=2,3, \ldots, 28$. This means that the number of three-digit numbers satisfying the problem's condition is 26. Therefore, the probability 
that a three-digit number divisible by 5 and having a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 can be seen on the table is $\frac{26}{1000}$.

Remark. The proposed solution to this problem claimed that it is enough to remove 7 vertices but the example to demonstrate this appeared to be incorrect. Below we show that removing 6 vertices is not sufficient but removing 8 vertices is. It seems that removing 7 vertices is not sufficient but we currently know no potential way to prove this, apart from a tedious case study.

For example, if a beacon is in room $A$ (in chess notation, this is room a4), and the robot is in room $B$ (this is room g4), the distance between them is 5 links. The robot has the maze diagram and the beacons are marked on it. For what minimum number of beacons can the robot, when in any room, uniquely determine its location by sound?

Before you are two sets of problems. Problems 1 to 6 of the first set are solved by selecting the correct answer from the five proposed answers on this sheet and writing it in the table under the corresponding number. Only one answer is correct. A correct answer will be scored with two points, while a wrong answer will result in the deduction of one point.

Problems 1 to 4 of the second set are solved on the provided paper. The solution to each of these problems will be evaluated on a scale from 0 to 6 points. On the sheets where you will solve the problems, do not sign, but write only your code. Write your solution clearly and legibly with a pen.

The time for solving is 90 minutes.

## Possible solution.

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the amount of heat $Q$ supplied to the gas is equal to the sum of the work done by the gas and the change in internal energy:

$$
Q=A+\Delta U
$$

When transitioning from state 1 to state 2 under the condition that the pressure is directly proportional to the volume with a proportionality constant $k$, the work done by the gas is determined as

$$
A=0.5\left(p_{1}+p_{2}\right)\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)=0.5 k\left(V_{2}^{2}-V_{1}^{2}\right)=0.5 v R \Delta T .
$$

Here, $v$ is the amount of gas, and we have used the fact that

$$
p V=\alpha V^{2}=v R T
$$

Considering that

$$
\Delta U=1.5 v R \Delta T
$$

We obtain
