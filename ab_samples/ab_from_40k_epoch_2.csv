Two players have invented the following game: On a game board, 14 fields are arranged in a circle, one of these fields is designated as the starting field \(A\). Each player has a game piece and places it on field \(A\).

Then each player rolls a die. If both players roll different numbers, the player with the higher number moves their piece 4 steps clockwise, the other player moves their piece 2 steps. If they roll the same number, each player moves their piece 3 steps forward.

This rolling and moving of both pieces is considered one turn. Due to the circular arrangement of the fields, it is possible for a piece to reach or pass field \(A\) (and thus start a new lap) during its movement.

The game is over as soon as after performing a turn, the piece of at least one player lands exactly on field \(A\). This player wins if the other player's piece is not on \(A\). However, if both pieces are on \(A\), the game ends in a draw.

## Solutions to Problems and Scoring Guide

A participant who arrives at the solution through any correct method (even if the scoring guide does not anticipate it) receives all possible points.

A correct method is one that

- sensibly takes into account the wording of the problem,
- leads to the solution of the problem,
- is mathematically correct and complete.

A participant who has only partially solved the problem, from otherwise correct steps in solving but does not show the path to the final solution of the problem, cannot receive more than half of the possible points.

## PART I

The correct answers are recorded in the table. A correct answer by the participant is scored with 2 points, an incorrect answer with -1 point, and a blank field in the table with 0 points.

Six friends live in a small town in southern France.

The friends agreed to split up and see them separately, and since time was limited, each chose three attractions and visited only those. In the evening, they met and began discussing which places each of them had visited. Each named their three attractions, but two of the friends accidentally got everything mixed up and instead of the places they visited, they named the three places they did not visit.

At a class party, the students present their math teacher with the following problem:

The students inform their teacher that they have secretly divided themselves into three groups such that every student in the class belongs to exactly one group. The students in the first group call themselves the ""Trues"" because they answer every question truthfully.

The students in the second group call themselves the ""Falses"" because they answer every question falsely. The students in the third group call themselves the ""Inconstant"" because each of them answers series of consecutive questions alternately (alternating) true and false; however, it is uncertain whether they will answer the first question of a series true or false.

Each student answers a question posed to them only with yes or no; questions that require other answers are not allowed. The teacher is to determine, by asking questions directed to any student in the class, which only concern the student's affiliation with one of the mentioned groups, whether the student is a ""True,"" a ""False,"" or an ""Inconstant.""

Consequently, the sum of the interior angles in the quadrilateral $A B C D$ must be $2 \cdot 180^{\circ}=360^{\circ}$.""

Anja counters: ""But if you draw the second diagonal $B D$ as well, you get four sub-triangles. The sum of the interior angles of $A B C D$ must therefore be $4 \cdot 180^{\circ}=720^{\circ}$."" Investigate which of the two students is correct! Justify your decision!

## Condition:

Six friends live in a small town in southern France. One day they decided to go to Paris together for one day and see attractions - the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Rodin Museum, the Bois de Boulogne, and the Champs-Élysées. The friends agreed to split up and see them separately, and since time was limited, each chose three attractions and visited only those. In the evening, they met and began discussing which places each of them had visited. Each named their three attractions, but two of the friends accidentally got everything mixed up and instead of the places they visited, they named three places they did not visit. Here is the list of places each friend named:

- Friend 1: Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Rodin Museum
- Friend 2: Louvre, Rodin Museum, Champs-Élysées
- Friend 3: Eiffel Tower, Bois de Boulogne, Champs-Élysées
- Friend 4: Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum, Champs-Élysées
- Friend 5: Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, Champs-Élysées
- Friend 6: Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Champs-Élysées

When the friends later started sorting through their photos, museum tickets, and sharing what they enjoyed, it turned out that each place was visited by exactly three of them. Help determine which two friends got everything mixed up and named the places they did NOT visit. In each field, write the numbers of the friends who meet the condition separately.

Therefore, $A=35 t+10, t \in Z, t \geq 0$. Since by the problem's condition $A$ is a three-digit number, we have $100 \leq 35 t+10 \leq 999$. From this, taking into account the integer nature of $t$, we get $t=2,3, \ldots, 28$. This means that the number of three-digit numbers satisfying the problem's condition is 26. Therefore, the probability 
that a three-digit number divisible by 5 and having a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 can be seen on the table is $\frac{26}{1000}$.

Before you are two sets of problems. Problems 1 to 6 of the first set are solved by selecting the correct answer from the five proposed answers on this sheet and writing it in the table under the corresponding number. Only one answer is correct. A correct answer will be scored with two points, while a wrong answer will result in the deduction of one point.

Problems 1 to 4 of the second set are solved on the provided paper. The solution to each of these problems will be evaluated on a scale from 0 to 6 points. On the sheets where you will solve the problems, do not sign, but write only your code. Write your solution clearly and legibly with a pen.

The time for solving is 90 minutes.

Problems 1 to 6 of the first set are solved by selecting the correct answer from the five proposed answers on this sheet and writing it in the table under the corresponding number. Only one answer is correct. A correct answer will be scored with two points, while a wrong answer will result in the deduction of one point.

Problems 1 to 4 of the second set are solved on the provided paper. The solution to each of these problems will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 6 points. Do not sign the sheets where you will solve the problems, write only your code. Write your solution clearly and legibly with a pen.

The time for solving is 90 minutes.

Add the numbers at the four vertices of each rhombus and fill the sum in the center of the rhombus at positions $A, B, C, D, E, F$ (for example: $a+b+g+f=A$). It is known that $A, B, C, D, E, F$ are divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively. Therefore, $a \times g \times d=$ . $\qquad$
Given that the positions of the two 0s are 6 and 12, the multiple of 7 is $14+8=22$, leaving the numbers $4, 10, 16$ which have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.

Only $14+8+4+16=42$ is a multiple of 7. So $d=10$.
The sum of $b$ and $c$ is 18, so $12+6+10+14=42$ is not a multiple of 4, thus the middle number is $g=8, f=14$.

Just as in the decimal system, addition involves ""carrying over when reaching ten,"" in the binary system, ""carrying over when reaching 2"" is necessary. Thus, we can obtain the following table comparing the decimal and binary representations of natural numbers:
